# Unit-17-Fitness-Tracker-Homework


As a continious fitness guru, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

With this app, we will:

dd new exercises to a new workout plan.

Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

View multiple the combined weight of multiple exercises on the stats page.

The idea is that a consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.
